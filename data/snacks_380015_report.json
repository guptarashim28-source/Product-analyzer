This 53g pack is designed for individual indulgence and sophisticated savory cravings.",
        "nutrition_analysis": "As a potato chip product, it's typically high in calories, fats (likely unhealthy saturated/trans fats if fried), and sodium. While \"Baked Olive\" might hint at a healthier profile, it primarily describes the flavor, not necessarily the chip's cooking method. It offers minimal essential vitamins, minerals, or fiber, and should be considered an occasional treat rather than a nutritional source.",
